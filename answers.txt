What is the difference between a merge and a rebase?
These are both methods of combining two branches. A merge will combine the two

The change histories of the two branches will remain as is. A rebase, on the 
other hand, will rewrite history as if these two branches were one, and will
merge their commits that way.

any changes. Many people can work on their own cloned versions of remote repo-
sitories at once, and then commit their changes to the one remote reposittory
